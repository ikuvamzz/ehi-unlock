# Installation instructions
- Download Node.JS [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node.JS Download")
- Once installed, execute "install-dep" .sh/.bat script depending on your platform, or...
- ... execute `npm update --save` in the same folder as the script.

# Basic Usage
This script supports arguments to avoid editing the file and exposing your Telegram bot token. Instead, you need to pass it as an argument at each bot startup, like so:

`node HCDrill.js -bt (your bot token)`
